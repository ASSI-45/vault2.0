# assignment
In Elixir we use the match operator. It behaves more like an **assertion**. What it actually does it check if both sides between the match operator match. What is the match operator... its actual the thing we call assignment???? in other languages the `=` thing.

So basically to my understanding with the example of `a = 1`. It will check if both sides evaluate to **true**. If so then a is 1.

# ignore values with _

the under score is basically a variable with will immediately discard its self. And will allow you to pas in other values in a pattern match.
